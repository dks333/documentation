### Testing the webhook endpoint

Clicking the **`Test endpoint`** button once webhooks are configured for your application will trigger a test webhook to be sent to your endpoint of type **`privy.test`** with a string payload. You can use this to verify that your webhook endpoint is successfully receiving payloads from Privy.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone your docs locally" icon="github">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview changes" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): `mintlify dev`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our Github app" icon="message-bot">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push your changes" icon="rocket">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Accordion>
